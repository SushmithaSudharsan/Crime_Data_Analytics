# Crime Data Analysis  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Los Angeles Police Department’s Crime Dataset (2020–Present)**, which contains over 97,000 entries. The primary goal is to identify crime trends, regional and temporal patterns, and provide actionable insights to aid in crime prevention and public safety enhancement.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Handled null values and inconsistencies (e.g., negative ages).  
  - Dropped irrelevant columns for streamlined analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Analyzed patterns, anomalies, and relationships between crime attributes.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Yearly crime trends showing peaks in 2022 and a decline in 2024.  
  - Crime distribution by area, identifying hotspots like 77th Street and Central.  
  - Temporal analysis highlighting higher crime rates on Fridays and Saturdays.  
- **Trend Analysis**:  
  - Highlighted consistent crime types (e.g., vehicle theft).  
  - Identified emerging patterns like a rise in shoplifting in 2023.  
- **Forecasting**:  
  - Predicted future crime trends, showing a spike followed by stabilization in late 2024.  

## 🔑 Insights  
- **Vehicle Theft**: The most common crime across regions and years.  
- **Regional Patterns**:  
  - Van Nuys: Higher burglary rates.  
  - 77th Street & Central: Vehicle theft hotspots.  
- **Temporal Trends**:  
  - Fridays and Saturdays have the highest crime rates.  
  - Sundays are the least crime-prone.  
- **Future Trends**: Crime rates are expected to stabilize after a short-term rise in 2024.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Data Visualization**: Static and interactive charts for crime trend analysis  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Visualizations  
- **Yearly Trends**: Crime counts peaked in 2022 and declined sharply in 2024.  
- **Crime by Area**:  
  - 77th Street and Central recorded the highest crime rates, dominated by vehicle theft.  
  - Van Nuys had more burglaries, while West LA saw higher burglary-from-vehicle rates.  
- **Day of the Week Analysis**: Fridays and Saturdays saw significantly higher crime rates compared to other days.  

## 📈 Forecasts  
- **2024 Predictions**:  
  - A short-term rise in crime during September, followed by stabilization in the later months.  

## 💡 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how data analytics can uncover valuable insights to support law enforcement and enhance public safety. It provides actionable insights for resource allocation and the formulation of crime prevention strategies.
